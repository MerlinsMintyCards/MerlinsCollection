"""Daily batch sync of catalog data, prices, and inventory market values.

Orchestrates the scheduled job that keeps DynamoDB current. ``run_daily_sync``
is the entry point; the individual steps are exposed for testing and re-use:

- ``sync_catalog`` — pull every card from pokemontcg.io, upsert catalog rows,
  and record one raw price-history point per finish for ``today``.
- ``snapshot_graded_prices`` — append a daily history point for each owned
  graded slab that has a manual market value.
- ``refresh_inventory_market_values`` — denormalize the latest market value onto
  each inventory item so list/search reads don't need a second lookup.

Each function takes ``repo`` (an ``InventoryRepository``) and returns a small
summary dict so the job can log what it did.
