"""Inventory domain models.

An inventory item is either **raw** (ungraded, has a finish + condition) or
**graded** (slabbed by a grading company, has a company/grade/cert). They share
``_ItemBase`` and are combined into a single ``InventoryItem`` discriminated
union on the ``kind`` field, so a stored item round-trips to the right subtype.
``InventoryItemAdapter`` validates raw dicts (e.g. straight from DynamoDB) into
that union.
